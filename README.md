REQUIREMENTS

Completed Analysis Uploaded to GitHub (20 points)
    Final data analysis contains ample and complete information in README file (10 points)

    Final repository is acceptable for professional quality presentation (10 points)


Visualizations (20 points)
    6–8 visualizations of data (at least two per question) (10 points)
        * Total of 8 visualizations done
            * 1 geoplot with dots showing relative size of popluation for each city
            * 2 line plots for temperature and precipitation by city for 10 years
            * 5 scatter plots for temperature vs precipitation for each city for 10 years along with linear regression equation

    Clear and accurate labeling of images (5 points)
        * All plots have titles, x-axis labels, y-axis labels, and units when applicable

    Visualizations supported with ample and precise explanation (5 points)
        * Explainations contained in PowerPoint presentation


Analysis and Conclusion (20 points)
    Write-up summarizes major findings and implications at a professional level (5 points)
        * Summaries contained within PowerPoint presentation

    Each question in the project proposal is answered with precise descriptions and findings (5 points)
        * Questions we asked:
            * Temperature: How much has the average high temperature changed for the largest five cities in the United States from 2010-2019
            * Precipitation: How much has the average annual precipitation changed for the largest five cities in the United States from 2010 - 2019
            * Correlation: What is the relationship between average high temperature and average annual precipitation
        
        * Answers to Questions (Observations):
            * The high temperature or total precipitation for each city did not show much variation from year to year in any city, except for when certain cities were subject to noteworthy natural weather disasters or droughts.
                * New York City showed high precipitation in 2011 due to Hurricane Irene and TS Lee (outlier)
                * Houston showed high precipitation in 2017 due to Hurricane Harvey (outlier)
                * Western US was under a prolonged drought from 2011 - 2017
            * Comparing the values for each showed there was no correlation between high temperature vs. total precipitation.
        
        * Answers to Questions (Conclusions):
            * There does not appear to be a relationship between maximum high temperature and annual precipitation. The OCSS team recommends other factors should be explored to identify alternate approaches for developing a more reliable modeling approach.  
        
    Findings are strongly supported with numbers and visualizations (5 points)

    Each question response is supported with a well-discerned statistical analysis from lessons (e.g., aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis) (5 points)
        * Correlation values calculated and demonstrate no relationship between max temperature and total annual precipitation
